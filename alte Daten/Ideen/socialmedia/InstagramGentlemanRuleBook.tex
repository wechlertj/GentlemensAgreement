-- Sometimes i just agree with people so that they can stop talking.
-- Don't lose your present to your past
- you are responsible for your own happiness
- passion never fails 
- its the hungry ones that get to taste success
- a leader is the one who knows the way goes the way and shows the way
my motivation is when people underestimante me
deep conversation with right people are priceless
what we achieve inwardly will change outer reality 
nerver give up on something  you cant go a day without thinking about
dont tell people your dreams
your thoughts create your reality 
the futurre belongs to those who belive in beauty of thier dreams
prevention is better then cure
the struggle is guaranteed thesuccess is not 
all great and presious things are lonley
somtimes were tested not to show our weakness. But to discover our strengths
the day you lose everything is the day you will know who your best freinds are 
winners make a list of shit they are gonna dontpeople hoe make you feel better about yourself when you are sad are so important 
a woman who wants the best for you is the best for you 
the secret of getting ahead is getting started
this is my decade
just believ that good things are on thier way
nobody cares about your story until you win 
you wll never lose what is meant to stay
healing means owning the pain without pushing it away
the goal is life on out terms 
demand more from yourself
face everything an rise 
though time dont define you. they refine you 
one good year can chnage your whole life
fake people have an image to maintain. real people just dont give a fuck
smart people will not reveal everything they know
kill those negative vibes 
dont forget to smile at the haters 
the things you regret most in life are the things you didnt dont
th biggest risk is not taking risk 
best nights are usually unplanned
hates make me famous
true friends celebrate your success as their own success 
most of ypur sins is because of your mouth
protect what you love
never give up because great things take time 
family isnt always blood 
belive in yourself and you will be unstoppable
dont give a fuck about the opinions of other people
the smarter you get the less you speak 
dont let anyone ruin your feelings
dont work for anyone you dont respect and admire
the massive characters are seared with scars.
the more you sweat in peacetime the less you bleed during war
